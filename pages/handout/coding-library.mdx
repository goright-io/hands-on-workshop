import Layout from "../../templates/layout"

export default Layout
export const meta = { title: "Coding the library" }



As a developer, you are working on **version 1** of your library. You
already have a product and it is functioning (kind of). But the interface
there is not componentized. Let's fix it.

**At this step, yout final goal is to create a set of components for your
future product**. Focus on the Storybook, don't change the product yet.
However, you can copy-paste the styles from the product.


## Updating design tokens

If you want to sync with the design library, build Figma tokens.
You will use in components and product pages.
The tokens are exported from Figma in one click with
[Design Tokens plugin](https://github.com/lukasoppermann/design-tokens), but the default
export file is not very convenient for development
 The purpose of _Tokens workspace_ is simply to transform exported JSON into
 JS object of a convenient shape.

Get the design tokens JSON
file from your designer, put it as `tokens/design-tokens.json` into
the repository. Then, build the tokens

```
yarn tokens:build
```

This command changes the files in `tokens/dist` directory. Normally, you would
distribute them as an npm package for all to sync. But in the workshop, for
the sake of simplicity, we are keeping it in the repository. In this case, you
have to commit the changes for your other team member's to sync.



## Adding new component

Quickly add component template files:

```
yarn add-component <ComponentName>
```

For example, if you run `yarn add-component Avatar`, a new folder with two new files will be created at `design-system/src/components`:

- Avatar/
  - index.js
  - Avatar.stories.mdx

component with code.

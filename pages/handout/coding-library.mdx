As a developer, you are working on **version 1** of your library. You
already have a product and it is functioning (kind of). But the interface
there is not componentized. Let's fix it.

By this time, you should already have a list of components to implement, aligned with
your team.
**At this step, yout final goal is to create a set of components for your
future product**. Focus on the Storybook, don't change the product yet.
However, you can copy-paste the styles from the product.


## Updating design tokens

If you want to sync with the design library, build Figma tokens.
You will use in components and product pages.
The tokens are exported from Figma in one click with
[Design Tokens plugin](https://github.com/lukasoppermann/design-tokens). Once
you got `design-tokens.json` file from your designer, put it to

### Under the tokens' hood

The exported is not very convenient for development, so we process
it with the help of [Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/).
You can see the result in `design-system/src/tokens/dist/`. These are the
the files that will be imported into the components. You don't have to change
anything there, but it is good to know how
these things work.


## Adding new component

Quickly add component template files:

```
yarn add-component <ComponentName>
```

For example, if you run `yarn add-component CheckoutForm`, a new folder with two new files will be created at `design-system/src/components`:

- CheckoutForm/
  - index.js
  - CheckoutForm.stories.mdx

**Note**. When you add the component, it get's re-exported in the library index file,
which is `design-system/src/index.js`. If you want to rename or remove a component,
don't forget also change there.

## Building the product

Make sure your project is built before you release. You can build
the product with the following command:

```
yarn product:build
```


## Preparing for deployment

We can automatically deploy the product similarly to how it is done for
the design system.

You need to edit "homepage" property in ./product/package.json. It should be pointing to your repository.

```
{
  "homepage": "https://<USERNAME>.github.io/<REPOSITORY_NAME>",
  ...
}
```


## Releasing the product

1. When you are ready to release the product, you need to run the following command to bump the version:

```
yarn product:version
```

2. As soon as you push your commits to main branch, a Github Action(`.github/workflows/release.yml`) will be triggered. It performs two tasks:
- Checks the version of the product and compare it with previous one.
- If version change is detected, build and deploy workflow is activated.

**You have to change product version in order to deploy**. Product version can be changed
in `product/package.json`. Deploy won't run if the version is the same.

After the sucessful deployment,  you should be able to see the product page
at `https://<USERNAME>.github.io/<REPOSITORY_NAME>/product/"`.



If you still need to deploy the previous version for some reason, you can run it manually:

```
yarn deploy
```

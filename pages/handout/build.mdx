## Building and releasing library

When you feel your library is ready for production, you can build it:

```
yarn build:design-system
```

A minified production build of the library will be created in /dist folder. Now you need to bump the version of your library:

```
yarn build:design-system
```

...and type the new version number.

Now go to package.json of your product (product/package.json) and manually change the version of the library:

```diff
  "dependencies": {
-   "design-system": "0.1.0", 
+   "design-system": "0.2.0",
  ...
  }

```

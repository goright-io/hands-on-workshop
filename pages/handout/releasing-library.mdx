All the components are coded? Before you bring them to the product,
let's reelease the library.

Do not forget that we serve design tokens and the library of components as different
packages. However, it is good to keep them synced and always release the tokens when
you are releasing the library.

### Release the tokens

```
yarn tokens:version
```

The release script will build the tokens, increment the version and commit the
result of the build. If you want to check beforehand that the build is not broken,
run `tokens:build`.

### Upgrade the tokens version in the library

Go to package.json of your design system (`design-system/package.json`) and change the
version of the library:

```diff
  "dependencies": {
-   "tokens": "0.1.0", 
+   "tokens": "0.2.0",
  ...
  }

```

### Release the library

When the tokens are updated, all the changes are commited,
you can release your library:


```
yarn design-system:version
```

Similarly to the process with tokens, you will be prompted to type a version.
Alongside with incrementing the version, this command builds the library and
commits the result to the repository. If you want to check beforehand that the
build goes normally, run `yarn design-system:build`.

**Now you can use the new library version in the product.**

### Additional information

When releasing the tokens or the library, you can run the command with one of
the flags: `--patch`, `--minor`, `--major`. They will fill the coresponding
version number accordingly.


### Why we are keeping dist in the repo?

When we are building the tokens or the library, their minified prduction-ready versions
are  created in `tokens/dist` and `design-system/dist` folders.
Normally, such folders would not be a part of your repository. You would keep them inside the
npm packages. But in the workshop, we keep it simple: you sync with your other
team members by commiting the compiled files into the reposiitory.

# Setting up the project

## Prerequisites

Begfore you start, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js 12+
- Yarn
- Docker (optional, if you want to run the tests)

## Cloning the repository

First of all you need to grab a template, which we prepared for you - navigate to [Project template](https://github.com/bridge-design/hands-on-workshop) and press green button "Use this template". Now you have your own copy of working repository.

Then install dependencies: 

```
yarn install
```

## Building Figma tokens

3. Before you start working with components and product pages, you need to prepare the tokens,exported from Figma. 
Simply run: 

```
yarn build:tokens
```

You have to run this command every time you reexport design tokens from Figma.
Refer to <a href="https://github.com/bridge-design/hands-on-workshop#tokens">README</a> section for more details on how tokens are built.

## Working with component library.

To start your library in development mode, run:

```
yarn start
```



This command will start storybook server at [http://localhost:6006/](http://localhost:6006)
The storybook already contain some basic pages - Typography and color palette, as well as 2 components - icon and Button.

## Running tests

To run tests, make sure that storybook server has started, as described above. Then execute the commands in separate terminal window:

```
yarn test
```

## Building library

When you feel your library is ready for production, build it:

```
yarn build:design-system
```

This will create a minified production build of the library in /dist folder. This library is being imported into product workspace.

## Developing a product

Run the following command to start product development server:

```
yarn product
```

To create production build, run:

```
yarn build
```

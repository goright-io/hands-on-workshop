## Developing a final product

Product workspace is based on [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Both tokens and design-sytems are imported as packages. Make sure they are built, otherwise you will get a dependency error.

The following command will start product development server:

```
yarn product
```

## Updating the product

Go to package.json of your product (`product/package.json`) and change the
version of the library:

```diff
  "dependencies": {
-   "design-system": "0.1.0", 
+   "design-system": "0.2.0",
  ...
  }

```



## Building a product

You can build product with the following command:

```
yarn build:product
```



## Deployment
If you want to take advantage of github actions and continuosly deploy your product and storybook to github pages, you will need to set a few things:

For product deployment, you need to edit "homepage" property in ./product/package.json. It should be pointing to your repository.

Currently there are two deployment workflow, triggered on changes in product workspace and on library release respectively.

### Good to know
On free Github account only public repos can be deployed. Make sure your working repository is public, and the deployment branch is set to "gh-pages". It can be checked and fixed in repository settinds on Github.

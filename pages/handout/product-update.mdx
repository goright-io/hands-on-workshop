## Developing a final product

Product workspace is based on [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Both tokens and design-sytems are imported as packages. Make sure they are built, otherwise you will get a dependency error.

The following command will start product development server:

```
yarn product
```

## Updating the product

Go to package.json of your product (`product/package.json`) and change the
version of the library:

```diff
  "dependencies": {
-   "design-system": "0.1.0", 
+   "design-system": "0.2.0",
  ...
  }

```

Change the product files to use new components and
see them in action as you development server is running.

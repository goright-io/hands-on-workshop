            This workshop helps you learn and practice design systems working in
            a team. You can join as a designer or developer.
          </p>
          <p className=" text-xl leading-8 my-4">
            The designers define visual design language and Figma components. At
            the same time, the developers create the components with React. You
            practice iterative component-driven design and development and
            create documentation along with making the product. The exercise
            contains managing collaborative updates and keeping the code in sync
            with the design reality.
          </p>
          <p className=" text-xl leading-8 my-4">
            By the end of the day, each team has a ready-to-use component
            library, an end product built out of that, and a tuned process to
            ensure smooth updates.

            When focused on your product and taking into account your team
            shape, the workshop outcome is not only a training session but also
            your design system's kick-off. Weâ€™ll walk through the design system
            process, how to get started and how to fit it into your existing
            design processes. There will be an opportunity for the team to
            discuss questions they might have about implementing a design
            system.
